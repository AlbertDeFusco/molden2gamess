#molden2gamess#

This python script is intented to convert cartesian orbitals and basis set specified in [Molden Format](http://www.cmbi.ru.nl/molden/molden_format.html).

As of right now this script works for
* RHF- and UHF-based methods
* Basis sets up to f functions
* Basis sets with SP functions

If the Molden file was generated by Turbomole, add the `-t` flag since the d and f orbital coefficients need to be scaled by sqrt(3) and sqrt(15), respesctively, to match what is expected by GAMESS.

Example Molden format files are provided in the `tests` directory.

<b>Reminder:</b> This script cannot set `ISPHER`, `ICHARG`, `MULT` or `SCFTYP`, you will need to fix those values after conversion. Also, ECP input parameters are not included in the Molden format and must be manually added to the GAMESS input after conversion.

Usage:
```
> ./molden2gamess.py [-t | --turbomole] <molden-file> > gamess.inp
```
